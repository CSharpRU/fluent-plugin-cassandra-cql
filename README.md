# Cassandra plugin for Fluentd

Cassandra output plugin for Fluentd.

Implemented using the cassandra-cql gem and targets CQL 3.0.0
and Cassandra 1.1.x

# Raison d'Ãªtre
Currently, there's another Fluentd Cassandra plugin [see
here](https://github.com/tomitakazutaka/fluent-plugin-cassandra)

It's implemented via the Twitter Cassandra gem, which:

    a) doesn't provide all of the niceties of CQL, i.e., create/alter/delete keyspaces/columnfamilies
    b) doesn't allow a desktop client to make a call to a Cassandra instance hosted on EC2
       (the gem resolves a cassandra node's IP address to its private EC2
        IP address (ex: 10.x.x.x), which isn't accessible outside EC2)

# Installation

via RubyGems

    gem install fluent-plugin-cassandra-cql

# Quick Start

## Cassandra Configuration
    # create keyspace (via CQL)
      CREATE KEYSPACE \"FluentdLoggers\" WITH strategy_class='org.apache.cassandra.locator.SimpleStrategy' AND strategy_options:replication_factor=1;

    # create table (column family)
      CREATE TABLE events (id varchar, ts bigint, payload text, PRIMARY KEY (id, ts)) WITH CLUSTERING ORDER BY (ts DESC);
      

## Fluentd.conf Configuration
    <match cassandra.**>
      type cassandra
      host 127.0.0.1             # cassandra hostname.
      port 9160                  # cassandra thrft port.
      keyspace FluentdLoggers    # cassandra keyspace
      columnfamily events        # cassandra column family
      ttl 60                     # cassandra ttl *optional => default is 0*
    </match>

# Tests

rake rspec

NOTE: requires that cassandra be installed on the machine running the tests

# TODOs
    1) make host and port configurable for tests
    2) make schema definition configurable
    3) add rake task to generate keyspace and columnfamily
